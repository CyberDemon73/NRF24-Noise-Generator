Flipper Zero GPIO NRF24 Jammer or Noise Generator
This project uses the Flipper Zero GPIO pins to create a simple NRF24 jammer or noise generator. It can be used to interfere with NRF24 devices, such as those used in wireless keyboards, mice, and game controllers.

Usage
To use the jammer, simply connect the Flipper Zero GPIO pins to the NRF24 device's data and clock pins. Then, run the jammer program on the Flipper Zero. The jammer will start transmitting noise on the NRF24 frequency, interfering with the device's operation.

To use the noise generator, simply connect the Flipper Zero GPIO pins to the NRF24 device's data and clock pins. Then, run the noise generator program on the Flipper Zero. The noise generator will start transmitting random noise on the NRF24 frequency, making it difficult for the device to communicate.

Safety
Please be careful when using this project. Jamming NRF24 devices may interfere with other devices that use the same frequency, such as wireless headphones and security systems.

Description
This project is a simple NRF24 jammer or noise generator that can be used with the Flipper Zero. It can be used to interfere with NRF24 devices, such as those used in wireless keyboards, mice, and game controllers.

The jammer works by transmitting noise on the NRF24 frequency. This noise interferes with the device's ability to communicate. The noise generator works by transmitting random noise on the NRF24 frequency. This noise makes it difficult for the device to distinguish between valid and invalid data.

This project can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

To prevent wireless keyboards and mice from being used to control a computer
To prevent game controllers from being used to control a console
To prevent wireless security systems from communicating
To test the security of wireless devices
Please use this project responsibly.
